This repository contains scripts and resources for implementing and evaluating reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms for the navigation of agents within dynamic environments.

Run experiments and evaluate RL algorithms using the provided scripts. Adjust hyperparameters, environment settings, and algorithm configurations as needed.
Examples are given in main.py (how to train and test the agents). 

environment.py: Python script defining the environment in which the agent operates. It includes functions for generating dynamic environments with obstacles and targets, as well as functions for agent-environment interaction.
